Recently made a Pokémon Auto-catcher for a popular discord bot -  Pokémon#8738, if anyone is interested in trading/selling/helping me find users to test/buy it feel free to message me here on git or on Reddit at: https://www.reddit.com/user/StreamerWithoutTaxes

The script itself will run but you will not have any image hash's imported until you reach out to me. If you are interested in using the code and acquiring your own MD5 hashes- feel free. But also know; the bot itself requires some modification to Discord.py's files which I will not give you unless reached out to through reddit.

Currently tested on and have caught 10k+ pokemon on 16 different accounts amongst the following discords:
